# Computational Lexical Semantics
Jovana & Angelo

## For Lonneke:

The main file is ```main.ipynb```: it contains the answer to most of the questions and the code for the extractor. The file ```experiments.ipynb``` contains all the actual experiments that we did and the code that we wrote.

We were able to POS tag the monolingual corpus (we used the IMDB corpus), but unfortunately due to a memory error (not enough RAM) we were not able to POS-tag the parallel text: this somehow compromised part of the results. You can try to run the code to replicate the error.
